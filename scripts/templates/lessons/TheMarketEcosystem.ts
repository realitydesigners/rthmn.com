                    text: "Remember that as a retail trader, your goal shouldn't be to outmuscle the larger participants or to predict every market movement. Rather, it should be to understand the environment you're operating in, recognize your place within it, and develop strategies that work with the market's structure rather than against it. This might mean trading less frequently but with greater conviction, focusing on longer-term trends driven by fundamental factors, or developing specialized knowledge of particular currency pairs or market conditions.",

                    correctAnswer: 3,
                    explanation:
                        'Central banks have the greatest influence on long-term currency trends through their monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Their ability to create unlimited amounts of their own currency and their focus on economic stability rather than profit gives them unparalleled influence in the forex market.',

                        'Despite their large numbers, retail traders collectively account for only about 5-6% of total forex market volume. This limited influence is further diluted by the fact that retail traders rarely act in concert, often taking positions on both sides of the market.',
