                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation:
                        'The Rhythm approach emphasizes that ranges of price movement are more important than arbitrary time frames. We focus on how far price moves (the range), not how long it takes (the time frame), as this better reflects the natural rhythm of markets.',

                        'When trends across different ranges (from small to large) align in the same direction, they create high-probability trading opportunities. This alignment represents agreement among different market participants operating on various ranges.',
